# EC3 Project

Welcome to the EC3 (Enhanced Canvas Course Creator) Project repository. This project is dedicated to automating and assisting in the creation of courses in the Canvas LMS. Our models specialize in structuring courses, creating comprehensive course content, quizzes, exams, setting up modules, and incorporating dynamic multimedia content, including interactive quizzes and VR experiences.

## About EC3

The EC3 project leverages a suite of APIs from Pipedream, Canvas LMS, OpenAI, and GitHub to create a seamless and innovative course creation experience in Canvas LMS. This initiative aims to enhance educational content delivery by making it more interactive, accessible, and engaging for students. We acknowledge the risks associated with using AI to assist in the generation of course content, as well as the ethical implications thereof; the EC3 Project attempts to solve those issues and provide a robust and consistent tool that anyone with a bit of patience can use to develop detailed, organized, and consistent Canvas courses that students will hopefully enjoy much more than simply reading the textbook while keeping education standards and content quality the top priorities. The AI models used in the EC3 Project utilize knowledge banks that only include reference material that are licensed under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ to reduce (and ideally eliminate) the use of unauthorized copyright material; doing so also significantly reduces the chances of incorporating misleading, offensive, and false information.

## Technologies

- **Pipedream**: Used for integrating various services and automating workflows.
- **Canvas LMS API**: Directly interfaces with Canvas to create and modify course elements.
- **OpenAI**: Powers the content creation and structuring logic with advanced AI models.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the project repository and enables version control and collaboration.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from educators, developers, and anyone passionate about the future of educational technologies. To contribute to the EC3 project, please follow these steps:

1. **Get Approved**: Ensure you have a GitHub account approved by the repository creator (jay-optimaed) to make edits.
2. **Edit via GitHub**: Directly edit the contents of the GitHub repository through the GitHub website to propose changes or enhancements.

While direct integration setup instructions are not provided at this moment, contributors are encouraged to be familiar with the technologies mentioned above to make meaningful contributions.

## Use Cases

The EC3 project can be used to:

- Automate the course creation process in Canvas LMS.

## Final Note
Hopefully, the EC3 Project will supercharge teachers' productivity and free up some of their time to allow them to focus more on individual student needs, add some fun bonus activities to their courses, innovate with new teaching methods, or finally learn to juggle - not just with their tasks, but also with classroom supplies.
